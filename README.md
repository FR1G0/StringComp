<h1>String Comparison Algorithm</h1>

<h2>A (let's hope) quick and simple algorithm that compares 2 strings and returns the % of how similar they are</h2>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

This is the first string, it's a very simple string and has nothing special
This is the second string, it's a very simple string as well and has nothing special

->  The string scoring system takes all the KEY words and compares each and every one of the first with each and 
    every one of the second

Example :

(Removes some unecessary words such as "this, or, beacause, thing, is, the")
KEY WORDS (string1) : first string very simple string nothing special
KEY WORDS (string2) : second string very simple string well nothing special

Which of the 2 has more words? : --strring2-- with --8-- words

so the score is 6/8 so 75% similar 

this algorithm needs to be trained so we can figure out the perfect % to assign as a suitable similarity value
